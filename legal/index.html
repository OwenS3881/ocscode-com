                                The Fruit Force game stores and processes personal data
                                that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                                my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                                phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
                                that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                                process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                                imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                                could make your phone vulnerable to
                                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                                security features and it could mean that the
                                Fruit Force game won’t work properly or at all.

                                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                TMS will not take responsibility for.
                                Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
                                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                                provided by your mobile network provider, but
                                TMS cannot take responsibility for the
                                game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                                access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                                allowance left.
                              </p> <p></p> <p>
                                If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                                may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                                for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
                                or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
                                accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                                roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
                                territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                                roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                                which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
                                that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                                using the game.
                              </p> <p>
                                Along the same lines, TMS cannot always
                                take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
                                need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                                runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                                Service, TMS cannot accept
                                responsibility.
                              </p> <p>
                                With respect to TMS’s responsibility for
                                your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
                                important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                                ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                                rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                                we can make it available to you.
                                TMS accepts no liability for any loss,
                                direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                                wholly on this functionality of the game.
                              </p> <p>
                                At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
                                currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                                both systems (and for any additional systems we
                                decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
                                and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                playing the game. TMS does not promise that
                                it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
                                and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                                installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                                accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
                                may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
                                use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                                to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                                (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                                will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
                                delete it from your device.

                                I may employ third-party companies
                                and individuals due to the following reasons:

                                I want to inform users of this
                                Service that these third parties have access to your
                                Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks
                                assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                                not to disclose or use the information for any other
                                purpose.

                                I value your trust in providing us
                                your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                                commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                                that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                                of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                                I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                                I do not knowingly collect personally
                                identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                                I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                                me with personal information,
                                I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
                                are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child

                                that you read them carefully before using the game. You’re
                                not allowed to copy, or modify the game, any part of the game,

                                shouldn’t try to translate the game into other languages, or
                                make derivative versions. The game itself, and all the trade

                                The Lost Flame game stores and processes personal data
                                that you have provided to us, in order to provide
                                my Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your
                                phone and access to the game secure. We therefore recommend
                                that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the
                                process of removing software restrictions and limitations
                                imposed by the official operating system of your device. It
                                could make your phone vulnerable to
                                malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s
                                security features and it could mean that the
                                Lost Flame game won’t work properly or at all.
                              </p> <p>
                                You should be aware that there are certain things that
                                TMS will not take responsibility for.
                                Certain functions of the game will require the game to have an
                                active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or
                                provided by your mobile network provider, but
                                TMS cannot take responsibility for the
                                game not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                                access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
                                allowance left.
                              </p> <p></p> <p>
                                If you’re using the game outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you
                                should remember that your terms of the agreement with your
                                mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you
                                may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data
                                for the duration of the connection while accessing the game,
                                or other third party charges. In using the game, you’re
                                accepting responsibility for any such charges, including
                                roaming data charges if you use the game outside of your home
                                territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
                                roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
                                which you’re using the game, please be aware that we assume
                                that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                                using the game.
                              </p> <p>
                                Along the same lines, TMS cannot always
                                take responsibility for the way you use the game i.e. You
                                need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it
                                runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the
                                Service, TMS cannot accept
                                responsibility.
                              </p> <p>
                                With respect to TMS’s responsibility for
                                your use of the game, when you’re using the game, it’s
                                important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to
                                ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
                                rely on third parties to provide information to us so that
                                we can make it available to you.
                                TMS accepts no liability for any loss,
                                direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                                wholly on this functionality of the game.
                              </p> <p>
                                At some point, we may wish to update the game. The game is
                                currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the requirements for
                                both systems (and for any additional systems we
                                decide to extend the availability of the game to) may change,
                                and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                                playing the game. TMS does not promise that
                                it will always update the game so that it is relevant to you
                                and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have
                                installed on your device. However, you promise to always
                                accept updates to the game when offered to you, We
                                may also wish to stop providing the game, and may terminate
                                use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
                                to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination,
                                (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
                                will end; (b) you must stop using the game, and (if needed)
                                delete it from your device.
